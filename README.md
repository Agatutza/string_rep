# Introduction
Repository containing small python scripts to load a file and count the number of unique words that are int hat file.

Dependencies: re package for splitting the original text into words. For no dependencies, it should be replaced by a parser.
Main assumption: that the input into the functions we have is as expected.

# Files

The file **script.py** contains a script that takes in the name of a file (inputed fromt he keyboard) and returns a dictionary counting all the occurences of  unique words in the file.

The file **script_severalfiles.py** contains a script processing all the file examples in folder **texts** and prints the results in files in the folder **results**.
